I'm a big UFC fan and always find myself converting timezones and trying to see what's the countdown to a certain event. The 229 is the biggest war in UFC history so I check that countdown a lot. Inspired by this I decided to have fun coding such a widget that would allow publishers to create a live countdown of their events.

{"widget":"qards-countdown","config":"eyJldmVudCI6IjIwMTgtMTAtMDdUMDA6MDA6NTguNDAxWiIsInRpdGxlIjoiVUZDIDIyOSBLaGFiaWIgVlMgTWNHcmVnb3IiLCJzdWJ0aXRsZSI6IkNvdW50ZG93biB0byBiaWdnZXN0IFVGQyBldmVudCBpbiBoaXN0b3J5In0="}

It's simple and could probably make use of some other options but I don't want to pollute the code with useless features so I'll just wait for feedback and see how far we can go with this widget.

I hope you like it because it's already useful to me :)
